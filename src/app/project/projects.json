Very full-featured, including an Ask an Advisor feature which connected users with an actual CFP/CFA to help them with their finances (all included in your subscription). The business end of things didn't work out, and so we shut things down mid-2023. We spent the better part of $1,000,000 building the app (employees + contractors, data providers/services, infrastructure, etc.). We're now reviving the product as a fully open-source project. The goal is to let you run the app yourself, for free, and use it to manage your own finances and eventually offer a hosted version of the app for a small monthly fee.",

Wave isn't just another terminal emulator; it's a rethink on how terminals are built. For too long there has been a disconnect between the CLI and the web. If you want fast, keyboard-accessible, easy-to-write applications, you use the CLI, but if you want graphical interfaces, native widgets, copy/paste, scrolling, variable font sizes, then you'd have to turn to the web. Wave's goal is to bridge that gap.",

We often need to use multiple applications together. For example, we need analysis tools such as GA/umami to check pv/uv and the number of visits to each page, we need an uptime monitor to check the network quality and connectivity of the server, and we need to use prometheus to obtain the status reported by the server to check the quality of the server. In addition, if we develop an application that allows open source deployment, we often need a telemetry system to help us collect the simplest information about other people's deployment situations. I think these tools should serve the same purpose, so is there an application that can integrate these common needs in a lightweight way? After all, most of the time we don't need very professional and in-depth functions. But in order to achieve comprehensive monitoring, I need to install so many services. It's good to specialize in one thing, if we are experts in related abilities we need such specialized tools. But for most users who only have lightweight needs, an All-in-One application will be more convenient and easier to use.",
